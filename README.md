This is a Web application for saving text from PowerPoint presentations. Implemented through React + Typescript + PHP. Presented simply as an example for a portfolio.

*At the moment, it only works with .pptx files (there is no support for the format until 2003 .ppt)

Processing takes place on my server via an API. The processing code is not included because ChatGPT generated the files â€” this is a pet project meant to demonstrate my ability to write precise code.
